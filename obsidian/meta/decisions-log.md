## ADR-0001 — Documentation lives in an in-repo Obsidian vault

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-31

**Context.** Project knowledge (why a pattern exists, what not to touch, how to add
a feature) was scattered across chat history, READMEs, and people's heads. AI agents
re-derived it every session and got it wrong.

**Decision.** All project documentation lives in `obsidian/`, a linked Obsidian vault
committed to the repo. Root `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `.cursorrules` are thin shims
pointing into it. Claude Code hooks inject the pointer at session start, remind on
every prompt, and block once at Stop when code changed without a doc update.

**Consequences.** Documentation is versioned with the code and reviewed in the same
PR. Every code change carries a doc obligation. Agents get consistent context without
re-reading the whole codebase.
